Form Validation Practice

This is a simple web application demonstrating basic form validation using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The form includes the following fields:

Each field is validated with custom error messages, ensuring that users input valid data before submitting the form.

 - Country Field Validation: Ensures a country name is provided.

 - Postal Code Validation: Ensures a postal code (numeric) is provided.

 - Password Validation: Checks if the password meets the minimum length of 8 characters.

 - Confirm Password Validation: Ensures the password and confirm password match.
